# Languisa

"Languisa is a fictional website built for a language learning company"

Languisa is a language learning website which tries to portray to the user that this is the company that will get them speaking a new language more efficiently and quickly.

## Design, Colour Theme and Overall Layout

Languisa takes inspriation from many different langauge learning websites, in terms of terms of layout, feel and overall presentation.

The colour theme is intended to have a warm and welcoming feel to try and engage the user in seeing more of the site.

The layout mostly takes inspriation from other language learning sites. Going from an about section to try to advertise to the user the products and it's many benefits to a pricing section where the user can select different versions of the product.

It also has a testimonial slider to prove to the user that this is a product that has been used by many people and a worth while purchase.

## Header Animation

I thought it would be a good idea to include a animation to the main header which includes a greeting in multiple different languages. I took inspriation mainly from the iphone start up screen which has something similar. I managed to built this by using the same concept as a infinte slider, which is to clone the first and last slides/greetings and then not apply a transition when it gets to the last slide, so it looks like it has gone around seemlessly. Whilst i also added a small keyframes animation to the greetings, to bring more life for when the greetings have transitioned in.

### Technologies Used

The technologies i used in this site were: 

* HTML

* CSS/SASS

* Javascript

* Git

* Parcel

Javascript was used for the functionality side of the site, like the Side-navigation, the testimonial slider and the header greetings animation.

Git was used for the version control and to make sure my changes were kept up to date, whilst keeping a live intergration to the online repository on github.

HTML and CSS were used to build, structure and stlye the overall layout of the site.

### Areas to Improve

Overall i feel the design of the site is good and portays a real language learning site well.

Although i do feel like some subtle improvements could be made. For example i feel like subtle scroll animations on the different sections content would be a little improvement that would bring the site to life more. While also i think a slight animation on the CTA buttons on the site would be a good addition to help draw the attention of a potential client.

This improvements will definitely be update i will look to be adding in the future.
